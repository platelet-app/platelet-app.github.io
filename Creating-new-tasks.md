# Creating New Tasks

A new task can be created and added to the dashboard, ready to be assigned to a rider. In this article, you'll learn how to create new tasks.

## Opening the task creation view

Look for the CREATE NEW button at the top right of the dashboard.

If you are on mobile, the button will instead be near the bottom of the screen.

**This button will not be visible unless you are on the COORDINATOR or ALL role view.**

The CREATE NEW button will open a step by step process to adding a task, first asking for the caller's contact information.

## Navigating

There are some navigation controls to take you through the task creation process.

You can switch quickly between the different steps using the tabs at the top.

Or you can use the NEXT and PREVIOUS buttons to go through each step in order.

Finally you have a DISCARD and SAVE TO DASHBOARD button.

## Setting the caller contact details

The time of call will default to the current time. You can change it by typing into the text box, or clicking the calendar icon.
