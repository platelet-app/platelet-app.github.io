# Creating New Tasks

A new task can be created and added to the dashboard, ready to be assigned to a rider. In this article, you'll learn how to create new tasks.

## Opening the task creation view

Look for the **CREATE NEW** button at the top right of the dashboard.

If you are on mobile, the button will instead be near the bottom of the screen.

**This button will not be visible unless you are on the COORDINATOR or ALL role view.**

The **CREATE NEW** button will open a step-by-step process to adding a task, first asking for the caller's contact information.

## Navigating

There are some navigation controls to take you through the task creation process.

You can switch quickly between the different steps using the tabs at the top.

Or you can use the **NEXT** and **PREVIOUS** buttons to go through each step in order.

Finally, you have a **DISCARD** and **SAVE TO DASHBOARD** button.

## Setting the caller contact details

Here you can enter:

- The time of call.
- The establishment (where the caller is from).
- Their name.
- Their telephone number.

The time of call defaults to the current time, but it can be changed.

You can search through the directory of locations for the establishment. If it isn't listed, you can specify manually by clicking the **NOT LISTED?** button.

Once the establishment is selected, there is a toggle **Same as pick-up?**. When selected, the pick-up location will be set to the establishment on the next view.

***Same as pick-up?** will not be visible when the establishment is set through the **NOT LISTED?** button.*

# Setting the pick-up and delivery

Here you can enter:

- The pick-up location
- The delivery location
- Contact details for locations or recipients

You can search the directory for locations, or enter an address manually with the **NOT LISTED?** button.

The address can be edited
