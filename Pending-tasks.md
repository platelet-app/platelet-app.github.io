# Pending tasks

Pending tasks are tasks that have been added to the system but are not yet accepted or assigned to any user.

In this article you'll learn how to see pending tasks and to accept or reject them.

## Viewing pending tasks

On the [dashboard](Using-the-dashboard.md), click the **PENDING** tab to view any pending tasks.

*Only Coordinators or Admins can see pending tasks.*

An indicator will show how many pending tasks there are which have not been accepted or rejected.

## Accepting or rejecting pending tasks

You can see an overview of the pending task by clicking or tapping on the card.

Please see [Task Overview](Task-overview.md) for more information about the task overview.

Here you can accept or reject the pending task using the two buttons at the top.

You can also accept or reject pending tasks using [selection mode](Using-selection-mode.md).

When rejecting a task using selection mode, there will be an optional text field to enter a reason.

Once a task is accepted, you will be assigned as a coordinator and it will move to the **NEW** column of the **IN PROGRESS** tab.

A task that has been rejected will be moved to the **REJECTED** column of the **COMPLETED** tab. You will also be assigned as coordinator to any tasks you reject.
