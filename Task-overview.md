The Search text box will let you search all users on the system that match the currently selected role.

The recently assigned users will appear as chips depending on the currently selected role, up to a maximum of five users.

## Comments

In the sidebar is the comments section.

You can:

* Write new comments.
* Edit or delete your own comments.
* Write notes only for yourself.

![Comments](images%2Ftask_overview_comments.png)

When **EVERYONE** is selected, the comment is visible to anyone who has access to the task. Use this for sending instructions to the rider, cancellation or rejected reasons, or anything else other users need to know about.

**ONLY ME** will hide that comment from other users. Use this for any notes you want to make, that aren't relevant to other users.

*Hidden comments are filtered on the client side and shouldn't be used for writing private content or secrets.*
