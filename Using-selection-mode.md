# Using selection mode

The dashboard has a selection mode for applying multiple actions on tasks. This can make working with the dashboard a lot faster.

In this article you will learn how to use selection mode.

## Selecting tasks

You can:

* Select individual tasks.
* Select all tasks in a column.
* Select all tasks visible on the dashboard.

To select an individual task, hover your mouse over the card. The card will highlight and multiple controls will appear.

Click the checkbox on the bottom left of the card to select it. The highlight will change colour.

If you are on mobile, long press the card to select it instead.

You can deselect the task by clicking the checkbox, or long pressing the card again.

To select all tasks in a column, look for the checkbox opposite the **STATUS** title, e.g. opposite **ACTIVE**.

All the cards in that column will be highlighted.

To deselect only the tasks in that column, click the checkbox again.

To select all tasks currently visible on the dashboard. Look to the almost top left of the dashboard.

Click the large checkbox. This checkbox appears next to the **Select** controls.

All the tasks will be highlighted.

If you click the checkbox again, it will deselect all tasks.

Clicking the checkbox when only some tasks are selected will also deselect all of them.

*The **Select all** checkbox control is not available on mobile. Use the column select checkbox or long press control instead.*

## Actions

When an item is selected, a list of actions will appear near the top of the dashboard.

**On mobile the actions will appear at the bottom of the screen.**

The available actions are:

* Assign a user or users.
* Mark selected tasks as **PICKED UP**, **DELIVERED**, **RIDER HOME**, **CANCELLED** or **REJECTED**.
* Duplicate selected tasks.

**Certain actions will not be available depending on the status of the selected tasks.**

When an action is selected, a dialog will appear.

For information about the controls when assigning users, refer to **Assigning Users** in [Task Overview](Task-overview.md).

Other controls for updating the **Status** of selected tasks let you change the time.

When marking a task as **PICKED UP** or **DELIVERED** there will be a text field for sender or recipient name.

When marking a task as **CANCELLED** or **REJECTED** a text multi line text field will let you enter a reason. The contents of this field if filled will add a comment onto the task.
